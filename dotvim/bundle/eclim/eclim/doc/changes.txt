     suggestions from being suggested.

     when importing a ruby project or adding the ruby nature to an
     existing project.

Vimplugin:
   - Fixed executing of some operations when vim is currently in
     insert mode (opening new file from eclipse in a new external vim
     tab, using "Save As" from eclipse, and jumping to a line number
