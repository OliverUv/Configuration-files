Just some of my configuration files for dev environment. :)

The vimrc file is meant to be sourced by vim-clients on all my setups.
On unix, simply replace your .vimrc with a symlink to vimrc.
On windows, put the following into your _vimrc:

source PATH-TO-.VIMRC

" :Configure to edit this file in a split window
command! Configure edit PATH-TO-.VIMRC
command! SConfigure split PATH-TO-.VIMRC
command! VConfigure vsplit PATH-TO-.VIMRC

E.g.:

source D:My\ Dropbox\Configuration-files\vimrc

" :Configure to edit this file in a split window
command! Configure edit D:My\ Dropbox\Configuration-files\vimrc
command! SConfigure split D:My\ Dropbox\Configuration-files\vimrc
command! VConfigure vsplit D:My\ Dropbox\Configuration-files\vimrc
