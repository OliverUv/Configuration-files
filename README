Just some of my configuration files for dev environment. :)

The vimrc file is meant to be sourced by vim-clients on all my setups.
On unix, simply replace your .vimrc with a symlink to vimrc.
On windows, put the following into your _vimrc:

set runtimepath=~/PATH-TO-.VIMRC,$VIMRUNTIME
source PATH-TO-.VIMRC

" :Configure to edit this file in a split window
command! Configure edit PATH-TO-.VIMRC
command! SConfigure split PATH-TO-.VIMRC
command! VConfigure vsplit PATH-TO-.VIMRC
