2013-08-23 04:58:30	~mr_daemon	eMb: I suggest you don't just go ahead and use them as-is but instead selectively /set shit
2013-08-23 04:58:42	&eMb	k
2013-08-23 04:59:07	~mr_daemon	also do note that this is set according to my preference
2013-08-23 04:59:14	~mr_daemon	for instanced I turned off a lot of default things
2013-08-23 04:59:18	~mr_daemon	that I just dislike
2013-08-23 04:59:33	~mr_daemon	like the right aligned nicks
2013-08-23 04:59:37	~mr_daemon	and vertical bar
2013-08-23 04:59:41	~mr_daemon	and the users bar
2013-08-23 04:59:59	~mr_daemon	and I also moved input lines and bars around so they looked like irssis
2013-08-23 05:00:02	~mr_daemon	and merged some as root bars
2013-08-23 05:00:07	~mr_daemon	instead of unique per window
2013-08-23 05:00:26	&eMb	yes i saw sshot
2013-08-23 05:00:36	&eMb	your settings looked v nice
2013-08-23 05:00:42	&eMb	very similar to mine
2013-08-23 05:01:46	sney	waifu gets into this mode sometimes where she'll just start listing things that were related to the last thing she was talking about

2013-08-23 05:02:43	~mr_daemon	sney: what do you mean
2013-08-23 05:04:06	sney	she uh
2013-08-23 05:04:58	sney	will tangent off from a conversation about, for instance, movies and will just start listing the movies she's seen in like the past year without really talking about them she just has to go down the list
2013-08-23 05:05:05	sney	it almost seems like a compulsive thing idk 
2013-08-23 05:05:31	~mr_daemon	Like
2013-08-23 05:05:35	~mr_daemon	just enumerating?
2013-08-23 05:05:41	sney	yeah basically 
2013-08-23 05:05:51	~mr_daemon	Or like wrapping it up in a comment
2013-08-23 05:05:56	~mr_daemon	about every movie
2013-08-23 05:06:30	sney	yeah usually there's a comment about every item and then it continues 
2013-08-23 05:07:07	sney	and it's sort of anti-conversation because it just keeps going and there's nothing to hang onto and talk about 
2013-08-23 05:08:22	~mr_daemon	Maybe she just doesn't notice
2013-08-23 05:09:28	sney	it's possible. she gets kinda defensive too so I try to be careful about that shit
2013-08-23 05:09:37	~mr_daemon	Yeah
2013-08-23 05:09:59	~mr_daemon	I was thinking 'SURELY THAT COULD BE BROACHED' and then my gut feeling was like 'this could be tricky, watch out'
2013-08-23 05:10:02	~mr_daemon	out of sheer
2013-08-23 05:10:05	~mr_daemon	primal response
2013-08-23 05:10:11	sney	way
2013-08-23 05:10:18	&eMb	mr_daemon: all these conf files go in .weechat ?
2013-08-23 05:10:21	&eMb	or something?
2013-08-23 05:10:25	&eMb	can't find in the docs
2013-08-23 05:10:38	~mr_daemon	Like, you know, when you burn yourself on stuff and your /body/ just avoids the place out of primal instinct
2013-08-23 05:10:42	~mr_daemon	it was like that
2013-08-23 05:10:45	~mr_daemon	but for relationships
2013-08-23 05:10:48	&eMb	they seem to have very good docs though!
2013-08-23 05:10:55	~mr_daemon	that's p. shitty when you think about it
2013-08-23 05:10:59	~mr_daemon	but still!
2013-08-23 05:11:14	~mr_daemon	eMb: It goes in ~/.weechat but
2013-08-23 05:11:18	~mr_daemon	eMb: you should just run weechat-curses
2013-08-23 05:11:21	~mr_daemon	eMb: and then /save
2013-08-23 05:11:29	~mr_daemon	eMb: The best help is actuall in-program
2013-08-23 05:11:32	&eMb	aham
2013-08-23 05:11:35	~mr_daemon	eMb: you can tab out shit out of /set
2013-08-23 05:11:39	~mr_daemon	and /help every bit of it
2013-08-23 05:11:39	&eMb	neat
2013-08-23 05:11:43	&eMb	:D\
2013-08-23 05:11:44	~mr_daemon	to get the current value
2013-08-23 05:11:46	~mr_daemon	the default value
2013-08-23 05:11:50	~mr_daemon	and what it actually does
2013-08-23 05:11:53	&eMb	oh nice
2013-08-23 05:12:53	~mr_daemon	Yeah it's p. good
2013-08-23 05:12:58	~mr_daemon	my favorite bit in it so far is the remoting
2013-08-23 05:13:10	~mr_daemon	They built a purpose-specific protocol
2013-08-23 05:13:18	~mr_daemon	that is minimal and highly compressed
2013-08-23 05:13:24	~mr_daemon	for remoting
2013-08-23 05:13:24	&eMb	wait so you no longer do this via ssh+tmux ?
2013-08-23 05:13:34	~mr_daemon	I still do but I also have that weechat socket open
2013-08-23 05:13:38	~mr_daemon	So I can grab my phone
2013-08-23 05:13:44	~mr_daemon	and run the weechat client for android
2013-08-23 05:13:45	&eMb	ah
2013-08-23 05:13:48	&eMb	nice1
2013-08-23 05:13:53	~mr_daemon	and it brings up an ssh tunnel
2013-08-23 05:14:02	~mr_daemon	and then speaks to my weechat instance inside tmux
2013-08-23 05:14:10	~mr_daemon	and I can interact with and see every buffer
2013-08-23 05:14:17	~mr_daemon	it's literally
2013-08-23 05:14:21	~mr_daemon	the best thing in the entire world
2013-08-23 05:14:38	~mr_daemon	instant access to whatever is going on in my client from my phone at all times
2013-08-23 05:14:44	~mr_daemon	It's just an extra interface to the same data
2013-08-23 05:15:03	&eMb	:/ doesn't seem like the config has centralized theming ://
2013-08-23 05:15:10	~mr_daemon	No :(
2013-08-23 05:15:12	&eMb	maybe that's a good thing though
2013-08-23 05:15:12	~mr_daemon	BUT
2013-08-23 05:15:16	&eMb	for extra configurability
2013-08-23 05:15:16	~mr_daemon	You could make a split conf file
2013-08-23 05:15:18	~mr_daemon	for you looks
2013-08-23 05:15:22	~mr_daemon	Also it's a bit dumb because
2013-08-23 05:15:25	~mr_daemon	colors are spread /all over/
2013-08-23 05:15:30	~mr_daemon	some belong to weechat core
2013-08-23 05:15:35	~mr_daemon	and some are specific to the irc protocol
2013-08-23 05:15:40	~mr_daemon	and go in respective sections
2013-08-23 05:15:49	&eMb	gosh
2013-08-23 05:15:50	~mr_daemon	but you can tell they are like, in the process of moving them to one
2013-08-23 05:15:59	&eMb	gosh weechat pull yourself together!
2013-08-23 05:16:10	~mr_daemon	From what I read they had it everywhere before
2013-08-23 05:16:19	~mr_daemon	and they created the weechat.look namespace
2013-08-23 05:16:26	~mr_daemon	and moved /most/ of the settings there
2013-08-23 05:16:36	~mr_daemon	you can just circular tab through weechat.look.*
2013-08-23 05:16:39	~mr_daemon	and check it out
2013-08-23 05:16:45	~mr_daemon	it's p. hierarchical and easy to browse
2013-08-23 05:17:00	~mr_daemon	it's just the bearded version of poking around drop down menus
2013-08-23 05:17:17	~mr_daemon	until you find a label that says something that roughly matches what you want to do
2013-08-23 05:17:22	&plus	mr_daemon: http://i.imgur.com/2Jf7XaY.jpg
2013-08-23 05:17:36	~mr_daemon	plus: I actually lol'd
2013-08-23 05:17:42	~mr_daemon	it echoed
2013-08-23 05:17:59	&eMb	mr_daemon: iset is a plugin or so?
2013-08-23 05:18:06	~mr_daemon	yeah but
2013-08-23 05:18:09	~mr_daemon	it's p. shit
2013-08-23 05:18:14	~mr_daemon	so don't install it
2013-08-23 05:18:14	&eMb	what do?
2013-08-23 05:18:16	&eMb	k
2013-08-23 05:18:34	~mr_daemon	I mean you can try it but it looks like it was made for a prehistoric version of weechat that didn't have all of the /set features
2013-08-23 05:18:42	&eMb	wait mr_daemon why do you have iso as default decoder?
2013-08-23 05:18:44	&eMb	are you some kind of monster
2013-08-23 05:18:48	~mr_daemon	Do I?
2013-08-23 05:18:58	~mr_daemon	wait do I that is a really good question
2013-08-23 05:19:19	&eMb	charset.defualt.decode
2013-08-23 05:19:29	&eMb	iso-8859-1
2013-08-23 05:19:32	&eMb	disgusting
2013-08-23 05:20:31	~mr_daemon	well
2013-08-23 05:20:36	~mr_daemon	it's the default value
2013-08-23 05:20:39	~mr_daemon	I didn't alter it
2013-08-23 05:20:45	~mr_daemon	According to the help
2013-08-23 05:20:56	~mr_daemon	it sets the default encoding for /decoding/ and whenever it fails
2013-08-23 05:20:59	~mr_daemon	it falls back to UTF-8
2013-08-23 05:21:10	~mr_daemon	which is used internally through weechat
2013-08-23 05:21:23	~mr_daemon	this is probably on the off chance something starts feeding you latin1
2013-08-23 05:21:37	~mr_daemon	It's easier to go from one to the other
2013-08-23 05:21:40	~mr_daemon	than the other way around
2013-08-23 05:22:06	~mr_daemon	But yeah since it's the default value I don't really want to change it.
2013-08-23 05:22:10	~mr_daemon	There's probably a valid reason anyways
2013-08-23 05:22:15	~mr_daemon	and everything works
2013-08-23 05:22:16	&eMb	hm yeah
2013-08-23 05:22:19	~mr_daemon	I can CATCH IT! MY JIZZ! ( ' ヮ')ノ.・ﾟ*｡・.・ﾟ*｡・.・ﾟ*｡・ヽ(ﾟДﾟ,,)ノ
2013-08-23 05:22:20	&eMb	weird
2013-08-23 05:22:22	&eMb	yeah that works
2013-08-23 05:22:33	~mr_daemon	Default /encoding/ is not set
2013-08-23 05:22:37	~mr_daemon	so it probably is UTF-8
2013-08-23 05:22:48	~mr_daemon	at least according to whatever the dev wrote
